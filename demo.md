## Demo

To run a demo on a single machine you will need:

* Perform the setup described in README.md
* Install redis
* execute `start_demo.sh`

## Interacting

Useful commands once the demo is running:

* `screen -ls` - list all the screen sessions that are running
* `screen -r client` - connect to the screen session running the client
* `C-a d` - (Read control-a d) detach from the screen - i.e. return to the terminal
* When in a screen, C-c (control-c) will terminate that program and return you to the terminal
